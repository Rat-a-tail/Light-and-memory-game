Submitted by: **Tyga Kinsumbya**

Time spent: **7** hours spent in total

Link to project: https://glitch.com/edit/#!/fuschia-gray-blanket?path=index.html%3A1%3A0

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [x] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [x] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 

Geeks for geeks,
stack overflow,
w3schools,
friends

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

When creating this submission, I did not know javascript and it was my first encounter with another language other than c++ and python. Understanding some underlying concepts like id's and what they do in addition to methods and some aspects of object-oriented programming were all aspects I had not encountered before and I found that talking to people to explain some specific language made it easier to understand what the rest of the code was doing. In addition to talking to people, I also watched youtube videos and tutorials when I got stuck with an element I wasn't sure with. I found it thrilling that there were elements or concepts I borrowed from C++ that made it easier to understand some complexities within the code I had not initially anticipated and applying some of that logic made a difference. The only other challenge I faced perhaps was getting used to using glitch as its a website I hadnâ€™t used before and so I just decided to keep trying out different things in addition to reading the files or looking up different things online.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

To what extent is C++ and other programming languages such as python important in web development since everyone seems to differ and there doesn't seem to be a clear answer so far. How do web development sites such as wix.com work? How does one build a website and is it still accessible to other people such that they contribute their own code to a project to make it better, especially in web development?

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

I would have added images such that when one toggles, they show up. I would also have tried changing the shape of the button. I would also have used references as some variables were similar in the function that they are playing so that would have made the code more concise in a way.
